# Ticketing System
This is a ticket application for selling concert tickets to the public, organized by SoundWave Productions. The repository contains two folders: front-end and service. The front-end folder contains the source code for the web application, while the service folder contains the source code for the backend API, which is implemented using a serverless architecture.

## TechStack

Ticketing System uses a number of technology stack to work properly:
- [node.js] - Runtime for the lambda function
- [Vue] - Progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework
- [Vite] - Fast and modern bundler for building frontend apps.
- [Vuetify] - Material Design for Vue
- [dynamodb] - Fast, flexible NoSQL database service for single-digit millisecond performance at any scale by AWS
- [PostgresQL] - Powerful, open-source, relational database.
- [S3] - Scalable, durable, secure object storage

## Font-End Setup
The root folder for Front-End projects is **front-end**.
### Front-End Environment Variable

```sh
VITE_BASE_API_URL=YOUR_API_ENDPOINT
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=YOU_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
VITE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
VITE_DEVICE_ID=YOUR_AUTH_DEVICEID
```

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
<hr>

## Backend - API Setup (Serverless)
The root folder for backend projects is **service**.
#### Lambda Setup
All dependencies required by each Lambda function are located in the **service/layer** folder and are bundled into a layer with name lks-layer.
